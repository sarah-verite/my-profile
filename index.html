				I'm a student at ESSEC Business School. I'm in my first year of the Global Bachelor of Business Administration. 
				I'm currently looking for a 3-month operational internship. 	
				Curious, smiling and organised, I would be glad to join a company team and use my skills.

				<H2>Hobbies</H2>
					<p>
					For 6 years, I went riding in a club. I was the team leader and we prepared equestrian shows. 
					Today, I love doing different activities with my friends and family. 
					I like to learn about psychology through videos. I also like cooking and especially baking cakes.

				<H2>Travels</H2>
					<p>
					Since I was a child, I have travelled to several European countries, North African countries and the United States.
					I have been on family trips as well as language stays.
					I really like to travel a lot in order to learn about new cultures, discover new places and landscapes. 
					Also, thanks to my studies I will be able to continue to discover countries through exchanges and internships.

				<H2>My associative life</H2>
					<p>
					I was part of the ambassador commission of my village. I participated in the preparation of the agricultural show which aimed to highlight the artisans, storekeepers and farmers of the village and its surroundings.
					Working in this commission was a very good experience of project management and teamwork.
